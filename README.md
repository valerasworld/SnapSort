**SnapSort** is an iOS App that helps unorganised and forgetful people who want to store and re-access important information by saving, categorising them all in one place and revisit them when needed with ease.

# 🚀 How it works

## ➕ Adding an item
When the user first opens the app, he immediately can upload new items he’s interested in, by pressing the **+** button, either at the **center**, or **top right** of the screen.

</p>

Once tapped, the user can add an item with the following fields:

* **Image** (in case there’s no image added by the user, the used image will be the one from the Link Preview)
* **Title**
* **Category** (the user is able also to add a new one, by clicking on “Add new”)
* **Link**
* **Comment**

When the user wants to create a new category, they can choose:

* **Name**
*  **Color**
*  **Icon**

…and when they’re done, they can have a **Preview** of how the chosen category icon looks like!
