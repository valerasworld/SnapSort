# SnapSort - Stop Searching. Start Finding.

**SnapSort** is an iOS App that helps unorganised and forgetful people who want to store and re-access important information by saving, categorising them all in one place and revisit them when needed with ease.

# 🚀 How it works

## ➕ Adding an item
When the user first opens the app, he immediately can upload new items he’s interested in, by pressing the **+** button, either at the **center**, or **top right** of the screen.
<p align="center">

</p>

Once tapped, the user can add an item with the following fields:

* **Image** (in case there’s no image added by the user, the used image will be the one from the Link Preview)
* **Title**
* **Category** (the user is able also to add a new one, by clicking on “Add new”)
* **Link**
* **Comment**

</p>

When the user wants to create a new category, they can choose:

* **Name**
*  **Color**
*  **Icon**

…and when they’re done, they can have a **Preview** of how the chosen category icon looks like!

## 🎯 Dashboard View
Once the items have been created, the homepage will look like this:
<p align="center">
<img src="/Assets/Views/Pastel_lightmode.png" width=200 height=420>
</p>

In this homepage, the user will have multiple buttons:
* A **search bar**, that lets you search items, either by their title or by what you’ve written in the comment section
* A **slider**, that filters the items by all, links or images
* A **category filter**: whenever you tap on one or multiple categories, it will filter the items by the tapped categories.
* **Heart button**, a filter of favourites items.
* **Settings button**, to switch from palette colours to bright ones.

# 🎨 The design
We decided to create a **simple and organised design**, that looks clean and customisable in just a right amount, both in **light** and **dark mode**, with pastel colours and soft shapes as to avoid making it feel cluttered or confusing.

Also, we gave the user the opportunity to select their **own type of colours**, choosing between pastel and bright ones, by clicking on the **Settings** button, located on top left of the screen.

## Pastel colours:
